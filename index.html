                    <div class="image-text">This summer the sky was orange for a few days, the smoke from the fires in Portugal drifting by. The air was stifling, golden hour at 8 a.m., sepia filter never stopping, the sun, big, precise, haunting, and I thought about the people of the coming decades who will see warm colors permanently, a sunset suspended in time. Where cycles will be broken or artificialized, leaving only heaviness, the future left behind, in the dumps of the past heavy with the dawn of history, and things that come to pass, simmer, half-life. In all this, I went for a walk to find a plant, field chicory, tender, reflective mauve-blue. <p> osomosis, the flowers had shut-down to protect themselves, closed</p></div>
